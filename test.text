Task: Notes App with Login + JWT Authentication
Overview
Build a Quick Notes App where users can log in and manage their personal notes.
• Login Required: Users must log in before accessing notes.

Features
1. Authentication
• A login page where users enter their email and password.
• Upon successful login:
◦ The user is redirected to the notes dashboard.
• If the token is missing or invalid, the user is redirected to the login page.
2. Notes Management (CRUD)
• Create a Note: Add a short note (max 200 characters).
• View Notes: Display a list of the user’s saved notes.
• Edit a Note: Modify an existing note.
• Delete a Note: Remove a note.
• Persist Notes: Notes are stored in an SQL database, linked to the logged-in user.

Tech Stack
• Frontend: React + MUI
• Backend: Node.js + Express
• Database: Any SQL DB (PostgreSQL/MySQL/MSSQL)
• ORM: Sequelize/Prisma/TypeORM
• Authentication: JWT for session management

Implementation Details

• Implement a login route that checks the user’s credentials.
• Generate and return a JWT token on successful login.
• Protect notes CRUD routes, requiring a valid token.
2. Frontend (React + MUI)
• Login Page:
◦ Recommended to use MUI components

• Notes UI:
